## About hwinfo

_hwinfo_ is used to probe for the hardware present in the system. It can be
used to generate a system overview log which can be later used for support.

For general usage instructions, see `hwinfo` manual page. Additional documentation
about [legacy features](https://github.com/openSUSE/hwinfo/blob/master/README-legacy.md)
and [hwprobe environment variable](https://github.com/openSUSE/hwinfo/blob/master/README-hwprobe.md)
is available in this repository.

## openSUSE Development

The package is automatically submitted from the `master` branch to
[system:install:head](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/system:install:head/hwinfo)
OBS project. From that place it is forwarded to
[openSUSE Factory](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory).

You can find more information about this workflow in the [linuxrc-devtools
documentation](https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools#opensuse-development).
